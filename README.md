# Welcome to WorkWork!

Hello!

WorkWork is the culmination of all my knowledge so far on creating a full-stack webapp using the PERN stack; PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node!

WorkWork is an app that will help its users keep track of two very important parts of the post-graduate process: Job leads, and ongoing study. It does so in a familiar, user-friendly, card-based format that allows users to create new cards for jobs and study materials, add to, edit, or comment on them, as well as keep track of the various steps they've taken toward their goals with that particular job or study material.

Read on for more information, as well as instructions for deploying this app.

## Why WorkWork Exists

Prior to creating this app, I was on my own when it came to keeping track of jobs I'm interested, and in study materials. My main tools for doing so were a GoogleDocs spreadsheet, and Chrome bookmarks. That's it! I saw a need, even if it was just my own, and created an app to help satisfy that need. Here are the details!

### Track Your Career Search

WorkWork tracks jobs with cards, similar to those you may have seen on other sites like Trello or Google Projects. The difference is that WorkWork allows for a lot more information to be added to and tracked within those cards, including other cards (e.g. contacts for a particular job opportunity), and relevant events! It's as easy as creating a new card, filling out the information about the job when prompted, commenting on it if you'd like, and adding relevant information as you progress. This way, you can see when you made your last outreach call, for example, or recall whether you sent a recently revised resume to your potential employer by checking dates.

### Never Stop Learning

Equally as important as tracking job leads, if not moreso, keeping tabs on your ongoing learning and projects is important to your success as a developer! Using study cards, you can keep tabs on training material and even a broad overview of any projects you've been working on. Knowing when you last coded just for fun or practice can be important for keeping up to date on your skills, new interests, or portfolio projects, and WorkWork makes it quick and easy to do so.

## Useful Links

WorkWork was designed function as a client dependent on an API server, and as such, requires both ends to be completely functional. Here are the links to the repositories, and a live version of the app:

## WorkWork API

This is the API for the WorkWork job and training tracker app.

NOTE: This app includes PostgreSQL Database Migrations! Please ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running when deploying this app, and follow the Migration steps.

### Set up

#### To deploy locally for development

1. Clone this repository to your local machine and change to its directory: `git clone URL/SSH workwork-api && cd $_`
2. Make a fresh start of the git history for this project with `rm -rf .git && git init`
3. Install the node dependencies `npm install`
4. Move the example Environment file to `.env` that will be ignored by git and read by the express server `mv example.env .env`
5. Create a new database, and update your .env to reflect its name.
6. Migrate the tables in to PostgreSQL: `npm run migrate`
7. (Optional) Create a test database, add it to the .env, migrate the tables in to it using `npm run migrate:test`, and test using `npm t`
8. Run the server in development mode (nodemon) with `npm run dev`

### Endpoints

This API was created for use with the WorkWork React Client (https://github.com/howe-jm/workwork-client). As such, almost all endpoints are designed to function solely for use by that app! Some GET endpoints are included for testing purposes, but shouldn't be considered a part of the API's main functionality.

#### Job Cards Endpoints

#### /api/jobs/:user_name

This endpoint will return ALL STATE DATA for the given user's job cards, if any exist. It will return an array of objects, with each object representing a single card.

This endpoint supports GET requests only!

Each card is formatted as in this example:

```
{
"id": 14,
"userId": 1,
"companyName": "Test",
"jobTitle": "Test",
"jobUrl": "https://www.google.com",
"comments": "",
"contacts": [
    {
        "id": 8,
        "contactName": "Test Contact",
        "contactNumber": "123-456-7890",
        "contactTitle": "Test Title",
        "contactEmail": "test@test.com",
        "cardId": 14
        }
    ],
"events": [
    {
        "id": 13,
        "eventType": "test",
        "cardId": 14,
        "dateAdded": "2020-11-22T18:26:40.773Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### /api/jobs/:user_name/contacts/:card_id

## Deploying the API

This API is currently set up to be deployed to Heroku. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repo on Heroku for the API by running: `heroku create`
2. Deploy the API to Heroku with `npm run deploy`
3. Create a database on Heroku for the app and update environment variables appropriately (Heroku should do this automatically)
4. Migrate tables in to the database with `npm run postdeploy`
5. Verify that the API is running using the provided URL and Postman.
